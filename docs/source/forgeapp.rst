ForgeApp
========

The "ForgeApp" is the `TurboGears`_ web application that serves as the HTTP
server. Familiarity with `TurboGears`_ and `WSGI`_ will help when developing and
deploying your own ForgeApp. Vulcan offers the
:py:class:`~vulcanforge.config.ForgeConfig` class as an abstract base for your
application's AppConfig.

This is a horizontally scalable service when used with an HTTP load balancer.
